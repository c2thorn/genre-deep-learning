# genre-deep-learning
Using a neural network to predict song genres using Spotify data

Libraries needed:
Tensorflow
Keras
Pandas
numpy
json
ipywidgets
spotipy

## download_song_data
This notebook will allow you to download your own song data using your own Spotify and Last.fm credentials. You can skip this step, and use the sample files for the next notebook.

## genre_deep_learning
Import a dataframe and train a model to learn to predict genres from audio features.

## visualization
TODO: Split the visualization tool from the deep learning notebook to let users simply import a model to see the results.
